This project is just something that I've cobbled together to work for my needs.
To use without modification you need:
- Written for Mac M series chips (you can change the encoder for other, nvenc works well)
- A way of running zsh scripts
- FFMPEG with videotoolbox extensions
- mkvtoolnix installed.
- Input files as .mkv

The output is in the output subfolder of the working directory.
I aim to tidy it up, but I'm bug fixing it currently.
